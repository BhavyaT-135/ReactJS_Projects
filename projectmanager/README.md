**Objective:**


The objective of this tutorial is to develop a very basic React JS application covering the following concepts:
- Create-react-app CLI
- ReactJS Components
- State & Properties
- Event Handling
- JSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension
- Lifecycle Methods
- HTTP Requests

This application is for project manager, where he/she could add new Projects, view the projects added. Also see the TODO items invoked from external REST API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

**Instructions for the setup:**
1. Git clone the project
2. Once the clone is complete, open the command prompt and move to the folder \projectmanager (via cd command)
3. Execute the command "npm start"
4. Open the browser and hit the URL http://localhost:3000/#, to see the output (screen shots provided below).

**Screen shots:**

1. Home Page:
It provides option to add new projects, display the projects already added (under the heading "Latest Projects"), finally list the TODO List by invoking the external REST API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
Note: The REST API link is a fake online Rest API from JSONPlaceholder, which can be used for quick testing and prototyping.
